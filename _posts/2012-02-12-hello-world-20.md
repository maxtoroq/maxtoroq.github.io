This is my second blog attempt. After falling in love with [StackOverflow][1] I decided I didn't need my (first) blog anymore, SO provided a much richer interaction. When I had a question I would just ask it on SO. If I had an answer, I would look for the question, if found and no answer looked like mine I would post my answer. A couple of times I post a question just to post my own answer, but that didn't feel right. With time SO got stricter on what kind of questions were allowed. Then came [Programmers][2], but never really connected with it. I don't understand why that site, created for programming questions not suitable for SO, has so many closed questions. What's next? Programmers 2? I missed the freedom to just post anything I wanted, no rules, no scores, so here I am again. This time I'm much more skilled and experienced, so I hope to connect with a larger audience.
