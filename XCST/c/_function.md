## Returning Values

To return a value from a function you need to use the [`c:return`](return.html) instruction, or return from code in a [`c:script`](script.html) element. `c:function` is optimized for logic, while [`c:template`](template.html) is optimized for content.

## Differences with `xsl:function`

As explained above, values must be returned explicitly, there's no implicit output.
