title: Compilation
---

The compilation process takes the C# source and produces a .NET assembly. This process is **not** implemented by this project, you have to invoke the C# compiler yourself, or use an IDE like Visual Studio. The C# code can be included in your existing project. A reference to the `Xcst` package is required.
