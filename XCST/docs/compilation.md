title: Compilation
---

The compilation process takes the C# source and produces a .NET assembly. This process is **not** implemented by this project, you have to invoke the C# compiler yourself, or use an IDE like Visual Studio. The C# code can be included in your existing project, see [Code Generation: MSBuild](code-generation.html#msbuild).

All XCST programs depend on the `Xcst` NuGet package, so don't forget to reference.
