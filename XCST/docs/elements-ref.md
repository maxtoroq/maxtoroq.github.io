title: XCST Elements Reference
---
In XCST there are basically three categories of elements: [XCST elements](#xcst-elements), which represent program structure and instructions; Literal result elements, which represent the data that is the output of an XCST program; and [extension instructions](extension-instructions.html), which represent additional instructions made available by an XCST processor or by a third party.
