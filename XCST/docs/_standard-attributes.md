This page details the **standard attributes** that may appear on any XCST element. The above example defines a non-existent element `c:example-element`.

These attributes may also appear on a literal result element, but in this case, to distinguish them from user-defined attributes, the names of the attributes are in the XCST namespace. They are thus typically written as `c:version`, `c:extension-element-prefixes`, `c:expand-text`, etc.

Because these attributes may appear on any XCST element, they are not listed in the syntax summary of each individual element.

## The `[c:]extension-element-prefixes` Attribute

The effect of the `[c:]extension-element-prefixes` attribute is described in [Extension Instructions](extension-instructions.html).

## The `[c:]transform-text` Attribute

The effect of the `[c:]transform-text` attribute is described in [Text Transformation](text-transformation.html).
