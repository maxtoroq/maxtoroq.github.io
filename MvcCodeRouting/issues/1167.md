      Hi Max,&#xD;
      Thanks again for the great project! I've been using it with my ELEFLEX project and
      the modularity aspect is fantastic! However, I am running into an issue with trying
      to override embedded views for customization/localization/etc. According to your documentation,
      it looks like a view in the host web application should take precedence over the embedded
      view if found. I've tried a few different ways but can't seem to get this working.
      Can you provide any insight?&#xD;
      &#xD;
      I have a web application with an embedded route setup to a DLL (with an embedded controller
      and View). Let's say it is for /Account/Login.cshtml. Where would I put a Login.cshtml
      in my web application to override the embedded view?&#xD;
      &#xD;
      Thanks again!&#xD;
      Dan&#xD;

      You can override embedded views using file views in your application. The VirtualPathProvider
      implementation presents a merged view (no pun intended) of file and embedded views.
      When a view exists in both file system and the assembly, the file view takes precedence.&#xD;

      Max,
      Sorry about this, my fault,  It is working. I wasn't using the full namespace of the
      controller for the view. Please close the ticket.
      
      Thanks!
