   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">Hi Max,
Thanks again for the great project! I've been using it with my ELEFLEX project and the modularity aspect is fantastic! However, I am running into an issue with trying to override embedded views for customization/localization/etc. According to your documentation, it looks like a view in the host web application should take precedence over the embedded view if found. I've tried a few different ways but can't seem to get this working. Can you provide any insight?

I have a web application with an embedded route setup to a DLL (with an embedded controller and View). Let's say it is for /Account/Login.cshtml. Where would I put a Login.cshtml in my web application to override the embedded view?

Thanks again!
Dan


From Documentation:
---snip---
You can override embedded views using file views in your application. The VirtualPathProvider implementation presents a merged view (no pun intended) of file and embedded views. When a view exists in both file system and the assembly, the file view takes precedence.

   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">Max,
Sorry about this, my fault,  It is working. I wasn't using the full namespace of the controller for the view. Please close the ticket.

Thanks!
Dan
