   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">Updated to the latest code this morning (after the fix for issue #276 was implemented), and discovered a new problem.  Links placed in the layout sometimes return empty strings.  I've attached a sample project that exhibits the error.  Just start up the site and there will be a link to the problem page that you can click on.

In the layout there are two links:
@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")
@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")

These links generate correct urls when you are on the Home page or the About page, but when you are at the /Admin/Players/Create url, though, these links generate empty strings.</div>

   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">This behavior is by design. Routes are matches against the current BaseRoute, so if you do Url.Action("", "Home") and the BaseRoute of the current route is Admin/Players then you are saying you want to link to [baseNamespace].Admin.Players.HomeController. Use an absolute controller reference, e.g. Url.Action("", "~Home").</div>
