   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">Using MvcCodeRouting with the default setup will correctly generate routes and @Html.ActionLink etc all generate the correct Url.

However if you are using another tool to generate the Urls such as MvcSiteMap (https://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider) or MvcRouteTester (https://github.com/AnthonySteele/MvcRouteTester) then it is generating null routes.

This seems to be a breaking change between version 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 - when stepping through the source it seems to ultimately be in ICodeRoute.cs approx line 112

     if (requestRouteDataTokens.ContainsKey(DataTokenKeys.RouteContext))
            routeContext = (string)requestRouteDataTokens[DataTokenKeys.RouteContext];

         if (routeContext == null)
            return null;

as routeContext is seemingly coming back as null when called from these other tools.

   <div class="issue-message" markdown="1">First of all, it is unfortunate that a patch release contains a breaking change, sorry about that. Even though v1.0.1 didn't introduce new features, I did a lot of refactoring in preparation for Web API support. I should have just named it v1.1

About the issue, MvcCodeRouting will generate URLs if the route of the current request was also created by MvcCodeRouting, this is to determine the [route context](/wikipage?title=Links+and+Controller+Reference+Syntax) relationship between the current route and the tested route.

MvcCodeRouting currently requires a RequestContext to generate URLs. This is not the case for standard routing, where you can do this:

```C#
RouteTable.Routes.GetVirtualPath(null /* requestContext */, new RouteValueDictionary(new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" })).VirtualPath
```

I don't know how MvcSiteMapProvider and MvcRouteTester are implemented, but if they don't use routing while generating URLs, you can workaround with something like this:

```C#
RouteTable.Routes.GetVirtualPath(new RequestContext(Context/* current HttpContext */, new RouteData { DataTokens = { { "MvcCodeRouting.RouteContext", "" } } }), new RouteValueDictionary(new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" })).VirtualPath
```

If they do use routing, then you can add `"MvcCodeRouting.RouteContext", ""` to the DataTokens of their routes.

I hope this all makes sense, don't hesitate to ask more questions if you don't understand. I am willing to improve support for this use case if we can come up with a well justified and robust feature specification.

May be this [demo project](https://github.com/lvv83/MvcSiteMapNodeProvider_MvcCodeRouting) will help with __MvcSiteMapNodeProvider__?
