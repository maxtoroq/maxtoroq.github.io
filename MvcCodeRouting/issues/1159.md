Using the tilde character `~` for baseRoute-relative references is confusing, considering that it's used for application-relative paths everywhere else, e.g.

- Razor: `<a href="~/">Home</a>` 
- View engine: `Html.Partial("~/Views/Shared/Foo.cshtml")`
- Other: `VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/foo")`

Using the double tilde `~~` for application-relative references is also confusing, given the above. It also looks weird.

### Proposal for v2
Change the single tilde to application-relative (keeping the double tilde for back compat) and introduce a new character for baseRoute-relative, e.g. `Url.Action("", "^Account")`

Note: Custom routes also use single tilde.
