   <div class="discussion-message">Hello guys,<br />
<br />
Im using MVCCoderouting and its working just fine.<br />
<br />
I ran into an issue that I hope somebody can help me.<br />
<br />
I have one Project names &quot;MyWebProject&quot; using Asp.Net MVC 4. I have one folder called Folder1 at the very first level (same level as controller folders). I also have a controller called Folder1.<br />
<br />
When I browse to folder1, I got 403 (forbidden) because mvc is looking at the &quot;root folder&quot; instead of routing to the controller.<br />
<br />
Project Structure (reduced)<br />
<pre><code>- MyWebProject
   - Controllers
       - Folder1
           Folder1Controller.cs
   - Folder1
   - Views
      - Folder1
         Index.cshtml
  </code></pre>

How can I ignore root folders and Always use routing based lookup ?<br />
<br />
This post has exact the same issue (but I cant delete the root folder - it is a folder from NServiceBus and I cant get rid of it)<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">I found an answer for this issue:<br />
<br />
By setting routes.RouteExistingFiles = true; will force MVC to route even existing files/folders :)<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
