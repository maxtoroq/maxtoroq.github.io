   <div class="discussion-message">Hi Max,<br />
<br />
I have been successful in putting a controller/view combination in a shared library (project 2) and then routing to it from a web app (project 1).<br />
<br />
Now I am adding a 3rd project to my solution (as a plug-in style feature set). Project 1 is still the main web app, but I have shared logic I want the controller from library project 2 to handle. After handling the logic, I want the output to come from a view stored in project 3.<br />
<br />
Is this possible with your framework?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Wade<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Perhaps it's possible if both project 2 and project 3 use the same base route. But I wouldn't recommend even trying it. Best option is to copy the view from project 3 to the host app.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">BTW, you can always do <code>View(&quot;~/full/path/to/view.cshtml&quot;)</code>, that should work.<br />
