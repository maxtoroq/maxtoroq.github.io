   <div class="discussion-message">I have created a MVC site that uses MvcCodeRouting to register routes for 2 'modules' - which are MVC sites where the content items are all set to 'Embedded Resource'. <br />
<br />
A simple view works great, but I have a problem when I give that view a layout. The layout is also an embedded resource.<br />
<br />
Currently my view looks like:<br />
<br />
@model dynamic<br />
<br />
@{<br />
<pre><code>ViewBag.Title = &quot;A Module&quot;;
Layout = &quot;~/Views/_LayoutPage.cshtml&quot;;</code></pre>

}<br />
...<br />
<br />
But at runtime I get:<br />
<br />
The layout page &quot;~/Views/_LayoutPage.cshtml&quot; could not be found at the following path: &quot;~/Views/_LayoutPage.cshtml&quot;.<br />
<br />
I expect I need a different syntax/path for the layout page, but I don't know where to start with working this out. Is there a document describing how paths should be specified?<br />
<br />
Note, the Layout page is in my assembly at 'Workstations.Views._LayoutPage.cshtml'<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">There's no special syntax/path needed. &quot;~/Views/_LayoutPage.cshtml&quot; is an absolute path, if the file is in the Workstations assembly, and that assembly was registered using a base route (e.g. &quot;Workstations&quot;), then the path should be &quot;~/Views/Workstations/_LayoutPage.cshtml&quot;. I do not recommend you do this, because you are introducing a dependency between the Workstations module and the host application, where you are hard-coding the base route, which is something the host application should freely decide what to use. Instead I recommend you use a relative path for the layout. You can also embed a _ViewStart.cshtml page to avoid having to set the layout on every page.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this helps.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">You got me thinking, maybe the tilde should be baseRoute-relative for views location, like it is for URL generation and custom routes. It would be a breaking change though, so it'll have to wait for v2. I'll think about it.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Thanks for your help - what does the tilde do currently? <br />
I have seen ~ and ~~ in some posts - I haven't got my head around what the effect of using this is!<br />
<br />
A relative path works fine, as you suggested. <br />
<br />
This is fine for my immediate requirements. Thanks<br />
