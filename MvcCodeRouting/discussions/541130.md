   <div class="discussion-message">My system is divided into 2 parts. Service using MVC (not WebApi) and front using ember and both run on different ports or url. when i test service methods, routing works fine, but when I make call from client, it does not route to correct methods. <br />
<br />
I am using mvccoderouting and it helped a lot with routes.<br />
<br />
Cross Domain origin is allowed and all method types are allows.<br />
<br />
Weird thing is that it is happening on windows 8 machine, which is dev machine but same service when deployed on server works fine. <br />
<br />
I tried to follow the route by debugging and still trying to figure out way to put full trace on mvc.<br />
<br />
Any help or direction is appreciated.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Sounds like a configuration issue, not related with MvcCodeRouting. <br />
<br />
Check both computers have the same .net version, integrated/classic mode, web.config settings.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">I looked into it almost whole day today. I will check tomorrow. I feel the same, some IIS config difference most probably.
