<p>Case: I have a long hierarchy like Admin/Projects/Internal/View/Staff. It's simple to reference root-level controllers with '~', or set of child with '&#43;'. But, I can't simple reference from 'View' or 'Staff' level to frequently used action in 'Internals'-level
 controller, it's need to use '~Admin.Projects.Internals' because of '..' syntax can't be used both in 'View' ('Internal' are parent) and 'Staff' ('Internals' are grandparent) level.</p>
<p>jQuery has great function named 'closest' - http://api.jquery.com/closest/, that go up from current level until find matching element. Use similar logic, we can write simple rule like '&lt;-Internals', and use it in all descendent levels without worry about
 route errors.</p>
<p>It's not feature request, but my thinks about routing optimization :)</p>

   <div class="discussion-message">Yes, I've thought about this, but I'm not sure if it's worth the<br>
trouble. You have to make sure all routes don't match in the current<br>
context before testing in a higher context, so you would have to wrap<br>
RouteCollection or something, you cannot implement it in CodeRoute.</div>
