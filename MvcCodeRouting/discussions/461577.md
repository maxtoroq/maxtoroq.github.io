   <div class="discussion-message">I've started using your framework and it seems to work really well for my needs. I'm at a point where I am wiring up some APIControllers along side my already functional standard Controller framework. I noticed from one of the Oct 2012 discussions in this forum that you have provided ApiController support. However I don't see how to wire this up. <br />
<br />
I am using v1.1 of your framework (pulled from Nuget). Can you please provide sample code for wiring one up?<br />
<br />
Thanks for an excellent contribution!<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Ok, I found the site <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http" rel="nofollow">https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http</a> and downloaded/installed the package without issue. <br />
<br />
Now what? Does the route.MapCodeRoutes need any special config? Do I need to following any special naming conventions (eg: the api/endpoint style naming that MS provides). <br />
<br />
A small example would be very helpful / greatly appreciated!<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">No special convention/configuration is needed. If the ApiController is under the root namespace you are currently using then it should show up in routes.axd. If not then just call MapCodeRoutes again using a baseRoute.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Something is amiss here for me. Your help pinpointing is appreciated. First here is the output of my routes.axd. <br />
<pre><code>// MvcCodeRouting v1.1.0
// http://mvccoderouting.codeplex.com/
// Format: C# - Visual Basic

routes.MapHttpRoute(null, &quot;api/{controller}/{id}&quot;, 
    new { id = RouteParameter.Optional });

routes.MapRoute(null, &quot;{action}&quot;, 
    new { controller = @&quot;Home&quot;, action = @&quot;Index&quot; }, 
    new { action = @&quot;Index&quot; }, 
    new[] { &quot;Bpm.Controllers&quot; });

routes.MapRoute(null, &quot;Bff/Ui/{action}&quot;, 
    new { controller = @&quot;Ui&quot; }, 
    new { action = @&quot;Status&quot; }, 
    new[] { &quot;Bpm.Controllers.Bff&quot; });

routes.MapRoute(null, &quot;Rp/Ui/{action}&quot;, 
    new { controller = @&quot;Ui&quot; }, 
    new { action = @&quot;Summary&quot; }, 
    new[] { &quot;Bpm.Controllers.Rp&quot; });</code></pre>

You can see I've created a namespace tree for Bpm.Controllers.[area]<br />
<ul>
<li>
For all my controllers that inherit from System.Web.Mvc.Controller - the routes were created properly. <br />
<ol>
<li>Bpm.Controllers.Bff.UiController</li>
<li>
Bpm.Controllers.Rp.UiController<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
I can access both of these using the restful url endpoints /bpm/ui/status or rp/ui/summary<br />
<ul>
<li>
However I also have 2 controllers which inherit from System.Web.Http.ApiController. <br />
<ol>
<li>Bpm.Controllers.Bff.ImportController</li>
<li>
Bpm.Controllers.Rp.ImportController<br />
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
I want to be able to access them using the same restful endpoints as the non-ApiControllers above (eg: /bpm/import/1 or rp/import/1). <br />
<br />
As it stands I have to fall back to the MS api/{controller}/{id} syntax that your framework was designed to avoid.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">I cannot see the issue from the information you provided. You can:<br />
<ul>
<li>Download the source code and see/run the samples project, it contains some ApiController(s), maybe by looking at it you can find out what's wrong with your project.</li>
<li>Send me a trimmed-down version of your project that contains only the necesary code to reproduce the problem, to <a href="mailto:maxtoroq@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">maxtoroq@gmail.com</a> and I will take a look.</li>

   <div class="discussion-message">I took your advice and downloaded the source code. Once I &quot;proved out&quot; that the apiControllers could be organized alongside regular controllers in a restful manner I dug into my code a little more and found the problem. Apparently the Nuget package didn't automatically reference the MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http.dll in my projects. Once I added that reference and imported that namespace into the controllers the proper routing appeared in Routes.axd. Most excellent!<br />
 <br />
Thanks for your assistance and I am looking forward to the namespace/restful url organization/synchronization that this provides. Definitely this functionality is missing in the MS framework and I appreciate the work you've done here to add it.<br />

</blockquote>
Not that I remember. I have 3 projects in this particular solution (mvc.net app, shared dll, and test harness). As far as I recall, after installing the nuget package it asked me which project(s) I wanted to apply it to and I selected all 3. <br />
<br />
The only thing that may be odd about my config is that I had initially just installed using the &quot;Install-Package MvcCodeRouting&quot;. After your advice above I ran a 2nd install using &quot;Install-Package MvcCodeRouting.Web.Http -Pre&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
