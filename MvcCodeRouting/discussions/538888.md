   <div class="discussion-message">Hi,<br />
<br />
i've used MvcCodeRouting to separate my controls and views into namespaces. I also want to separate the files by their physical folders. For the controllers, its working fine, but when i create views with nested folders, i'm getting this error.<br />
<br />
&quot;The view '~/SC/MultiEngagementMVC.Views.SC.Home' or its master was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations. The following locations were searched:<br />
~/SC/MultiEngagementMVC.Views.SC.Home&quot;.<br />
<br />
My Folder Structure is<br />
MultiEngagementMVC (Root)<br />
|<br />
| -- Controllers<br />
| --------- SC<br />
| -----------------HomeController.cs<br />
| -- Views<br />
| --------- SC<br />
| -----------------Home<br />
| ----------------------Index.cshtml (renamed to MultiEngagementMVC.Views.SC.Home.cshtml)<br />
| --------- Shared<br />
| ---------_ViewStart.cshtml<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated. Please pass me any example where one has used MVCCodeRouting with Nested folders for view. If i create the views at root level, everything is working fine, but the requirement is to create folders by engagement we do.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">The error message suggests you are trying to locate the view using an absolute path, e.g. <code>return View(&quot;~/SC/MultiEngagementMVC.Views.SC.Home&quot;)</code>, is that the case?<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Yes sir, initially i've tried with returning View(), then some post mentioned that we can use absolute namespace to locate embedded views. When i used View(), it had given a similar error mentioning trying to locate the view in ~/Home, ~/shared and so so. Its a requirement to separate views by their function and has to create views under various sub folders. Please let me know in case i can share anything else.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Please check this:<br />
<ul>
<li>Make sure you call <code>ViewEngines.Engines.EnableCodeRouting()</code> on Application_Start</li>
<li>Are you using embedded views? That renaming you mention (Index.cshtml renamed to MultiEngagementMVC.Views.SC.Home.cshtml) suggests you are. If that's the case you have to use set <code>EnableEmbeddedViews = true</code> at route registration. See <a href="https://mvccoderouting.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Embedded+Views" rel="nofollow">Embedded Views</a> for more info.</li>
<li>
Don't use absolute view paths unless you really mean it. Use <code>View()</code> or <code>View(&quot;viewName&quot;)</code>.<br />
</li>
</ul>
Hopefully that will make it work or at least give you a better error message.<br />
