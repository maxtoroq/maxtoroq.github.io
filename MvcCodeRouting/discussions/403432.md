<p>I tried to render an action of a controller (someController) in namespace (aaa.bbb.controller), which is not the same namespace as the baseRoute in (aaa.ccc.controller), using the following syntax:</p>
<pre>Html.Action(<span style="color:#a31515">&quot;Action&quot;</span>, <span style="color:#a31515">&quot;~~aaa.bbb.controller.some&quot;</span>, <span style="color:blue">new</span> {})</pre>
<p>It does not working, and according to the document, it seems &quot;~~&quot; and &quot;~&quot; will achieve the same result --- they all baseRoute relative</p>
<p>Is it possible to make &quot;~~&quot; really application-based? so it can use controllers from other namespace? Or is there some way to work around this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks~</p>

<p>Hi, it seems I don't need to use full namespace, just using the controller name it will automatically find the controller in aaa.bbb.controller.someController...</p>
<p>sorry for trouble you, I was&nbsp;stucked&nbsp;in the idea of using full namespace to locate the controller, did not try this way,,</p>
<p>thanks you~</p>
