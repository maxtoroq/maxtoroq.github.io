<p>Hi Max, &nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if the library could support attributes for custom-naming the routes. Something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="color:black; background-color:white">
<pre><span style="color:blue">namespace</span> Site.Blog {

  [RouteName(<span style="color:#a31515">&quot;my-blog&quot;</span>)]
<span style="color:blue">  class</span> BlogController : Controller
  {
      [RouteName(<span style="color:#a31515">&quot;do-something&quot;</span>)]
      <span style="color:blue">public</span> ActionResult SomeAction(){}
  }
}
</pre>
<pre>for: site.com/my-blog/do-something</pre>
</div>
<p>In this case the attribute on the controller would override the namespace. The other option would be to have the attribute on the Index() action to override.</p>
<p>I'd like to use the library but my current site requirements for these naming conventions are a show stopper :(</p>

   <div class="discussion-message">For the action segment of the URL you can use the ActionName attribute.<br>
<br>
In this case, do you want all routes to start with my-blog, or just<br>
routes for this controller ?</div>

   <div class="discussion-message"><p>I think you can still achieve what you need by manually adding routes before or after your call to routes.MapCoudeRoutes. &nbsp;Here is a basic example:</p>
<p>
<div style="color: black; background-color: white;">
<pre><span style="color: green;">//makes BlogController.SomeAction available at the url "my-blog/do-something".</span>
routes.MapRoute(<span style="color: #a31515;">"blog-do-something"</span>, <span style="color: #a31515;">"my-blog/do-something"</span>, <span style="color: blue;">new</span> { controller = <span style="color: #a31515;">"Blog"</span>, action=<span style="color: #a31515;">"SomeAction"</span>});

<span style="color: green;">//MvcCodeRouting generates routes here</span>
routes.MapCodeRoutes(<span style="color: blue;">typeof</span>(HomeController).Namespace, <span style="color: blue;">new</span> CodeRoutingSettings { DefaultAction = <span style="color: #a31515;">"Index"</span> });
</pre>
<pre><br /></pre>
</div>
It WOULD be nice to be able to tell MvcCodeRouting to ignore certain controllers, though, so you wouldn't have two urls pointing to the same resource...</p></div>

   <div class="discussion-message">Hey tyler,<br>
What I've been thinking for a while now is having a base route setting<br>
(need to think about the name since we are already using BaseRoute for<br>
the namespace part of the route).<br>
<br>
So, you could do something like:<br>
<br>
routes.MapCodeRoutes(&quot;Site&quot;, new CodeRoutingSettings { BaseRoute = &quot;my-blog&quot; });<br>
<br>
That way all routes would start with &quot;my-blog&quot;</div>

   <div class="discussion-message"><p>Ah yes, totally forgot about the ActionName attribute. Thanks.</p>
<p>For my use case it'll be all routes will start with my-blog. Your solution for a base route setting makes sense to me.</p>
<p>What do you think of this as an additional way to declare base routes?</p>
<div>
<pre id="aeaoofnhgocdbnbeljkmbjdmhbcokfdb-mousedown">[RouteName(<span>"my-blog", NameSpaceBaseRoute: true</span>)]
<span>class</span> BlogController : Controller<br /></pre>
</div>
<p>I know it doesn't make sense in a multiple controller per namespace scenario but the flexibility seems useful - at least for my usage!<br />I generally prefer attribute routing rather than since most of my routes have hyphens and knowing the routes/constraints on top of the action is useful.</p></div>

   <div class="discussion-message">I think this setting (base route or whatever name we use) should be in<br>
control of the person that configures routing for the app, and not the<br>
person who writes the controller. Usually they are the same person,<br>
but I want to support plugin scenarios, e.g. a blog service written by<br>
a 3rd party.</div>
