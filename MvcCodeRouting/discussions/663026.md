   <div class="discussion-message">Hello, <br />
<br />
Virtually all my actions have various parameters.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to set up my route config so that MvcCodeRouting will automatically generate the correct routes for all my action methods including the parameters?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to avoid putting [FromRoute] everywhere; it would be less obtrusive to have MvcCodeRouting just pick all those up by default.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
