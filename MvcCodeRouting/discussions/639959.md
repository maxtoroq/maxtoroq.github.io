   <div class="discussion-message">Hello.<br />
<br />
I am using MvcCodeRouting with embedded Razor views in separate DLLs. Everything works fine, but I can't debug them - if I place a breakpoint in the view Visual Studio doesn't stops. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to get this work? <br />

   <div class="discussion-message">I don't think so. If you are using embedded views only for a better project organization, then instead of embedding you can copy the views to the host app in the post build event.<br />
