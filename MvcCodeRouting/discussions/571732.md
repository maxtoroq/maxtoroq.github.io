   <div class="discussion-message">Can you automate the Extract-Views function from the post build event?<br />
<br />
I can run the Extract-Views function from the package manager console just fine, but when I try from the post build event it fails.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">No, currently it depends on some commands available only when executed from the Package Manager Console.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Why do you need to run Extract-Views everytime you build? It doesn't sound right. You don't need to extract embedded views to use them, only to change/override them.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Thanks for the replies, I have external assemblies with the views in those assemblies.  As far as I am aware, if I make changes to the views in the assemblies then I need to run Extract-Views to move these views into the primary projects views folder.  If I am developing - and constantly making changes to the views in the assemblies then I would need to run the Extract-Views every time to test the changes I have made.  Also, if I can get it to run Extract-Views automatically, in the future or if another developer makes changes to the views code, then on a build it would move the views automatically - making life simpler.  Please let me know if I have got the whole concept of how Extract-Views works.  Thanks<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Embedded views don't need to be copied or extracted into the primary project to work. Try this: delete all the views you have extracted and run the app.<br />

   <div class="discussion-message">Excellent! That works great. I understand now.  Thanks for the help.  This plugin is excellent - this is how the 'out of the box' mvc should work.  Good work!<br />
